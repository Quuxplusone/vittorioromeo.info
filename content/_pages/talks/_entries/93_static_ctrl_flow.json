What if you were told that it is actually possible to implement imperative control flow in C++14?   In this tutorial, the implementation and design of a compile-time 'static_if' branching construct and of a compile-time 'static_for' iteration construct will be shown and analyzed. These constructs will then be compared to traditional solutions and upcoming C++17 features, examining advantages and drawbacks."
