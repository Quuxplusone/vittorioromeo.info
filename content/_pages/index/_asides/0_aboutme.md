Hello! My name is Vittorio. I'm a Computer Science student at the *University of Messina*. I write libraries, applications and games.

I'm a modern C++ enthusiast - I love sharing my knowledge by creating video tutorials and participating to conferences.

I'm currently looking for a job or projects to work on. Check out my portfolio or contact me if you're interested.

Please consider donating if you enjoy my projects!
