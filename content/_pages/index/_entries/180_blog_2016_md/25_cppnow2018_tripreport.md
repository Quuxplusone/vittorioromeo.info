Is it possible to attend the same conference four (TODO: four or three?) years in a row while still feeling excited and mind-blown like the first time?

If we're talking about [C++Now](TODO), the answer is definitely **yes**.

I still remember how lucky I felt back in 201X (TODO), on my way back home from Aspen: the 30 miserable hours of flying had been worth it for an amazing experience of knowledge sharing and networking surrounded by beautiful scenery. Guess what? I feel exactly the same way right now, while I write this report on my way back to London.

(Heartfelt thanks to my company, [Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/), who sponsored my flights and accommodation.)
