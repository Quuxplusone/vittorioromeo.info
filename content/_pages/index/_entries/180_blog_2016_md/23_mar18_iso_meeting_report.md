* intro, with pic from twitter
* on behalf of bloomberg, thank bloomberg for sponsoring
* why I went to the meeting: my papers and...
* day-by-day
* Idea for article: using c++20 lambda template syntax for loops over types and ct-loops



I'm on a plane back to London from Jacksonville, where I attended my first ISO C++ meeting. Apart from the long flights and long working hours, it has been a very enjoyable experience for multiple reasons:

* I was able to actively participate in the evolution of the language and influence it by voting and discussing;

* Seeing the amount of work, the engaging debates, and the formal procedures used to move C++ forward gave me a newfound appreciation for all the members of the committee and for the language;

* I learned quite a lot about potentially upcoming changes and about the direction the language is taking;

* Last but not least, I was really glad to see friends from all around the world again and to make new ones!



I went to the meeting on behalf of my employer, [Bloomberg](TODO), who sponsored my flights and accommodation - many thanks! Two papers I authored were up for discussion:

* [P0915: "Concept-constrained `auto`"](http://wg21.link/P0915) *(co-authored with John Lakos)*

* [P0792: "`function_ref`: a non-owning reference to a `Callable`"](http://wg21.link/P0792)

The outcome of those discussions will be covered in this trip report, where I'll give a brief overview of how I spent every day and where I'll share my thoughts about my favourite papers and interactions.



### day 1/7

After landing in Jacksonville on Sunday, I was feeling like a zombie due to my sleep deprivation kicking in. It seems like my DNA has this *amazing* mutation that prevents me from sleeping on planes.

I rushed to the hotel to get some sleep as the first day of the ISO meeting was quickly approaching. Eight hours later I packed my laptop and my paper notebook and walked to the venue of the meeting, eager to finally have a glimpse of what goes behind the scenes of the C++ standardization process.

The meeting began with a plenary introductory session in a room packed with 100+ attendees - I was not expecting to see such a crowd! The room was actually very hot due to the amount of people.

After a round of introductions and an overview of the week's agenda, the people in the room started splitting into *study groups* and *working groups*.

If you're not aware of how C++'s standardization process works, [the "committee" page on isocpp.org](https://isocpp.org/std/the-committee) has a great explanation that comes with a suprisingly helpful diagram:

I began by attending a joint EWG + LEWG session. TODO
